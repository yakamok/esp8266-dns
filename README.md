# esp8266-dns

Featured on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2015/07/01/dns-tunneling-with-an-esp8266/)  

This proof of concept shows how to use DNS requests to bypass pay for wifi hotspots to get your data from the ESP8266 to your server, great to use with sensors.  

Would like to revisit this project and use MicroPython to do some new projects.
